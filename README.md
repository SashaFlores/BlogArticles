# Blog Artilces

This is a repo. that sets up an NFT for my blog readers to mint, most of the articles, tutorials, and guides will be free and up to the fellow developers to support my content, but some advanced tutorials will require minting an NFT to access as it will include advanced tech topics and various stacks so that developers who prefer web3.js over ethers.js or vice versa for an example will be able to follow along with no problem. These supported tutorials will be implemented using both stacks.

### Tech Stack:

- hardhat-deploy
- hardhat-ethers
- solidity coverage
- chai & chai-matchers
- ethers.js v6.7.1
- gas reporter
- Slither
- Mythx


Note: more details will be disclosed soon. Thanks for your patience.
